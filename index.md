\>12 Years Experience in engineering and software development.

## About me

I am a Dresden based software engineer and I am always looking for new challenges and to improve my skills.

With an educational background in mechatronics at the Technical University of Dresden, I have a strong foundation in mechanical and electrical engineering. But I still ended up in software development as this already had been my passion starting in my teenage years.

I have worked both in dev teams (Scrum) and as a solo developer.

For a successful project, not only programming is important, but also code reviews, testing and automating the build process.
