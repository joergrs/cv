## About me

I am a Dresden based software engineer and I am always looking for new challenges and to improve my skills.

With an educational background in mechatronics at the Technical University of Dresden, I have a strong foundation in mechanical and electrical engineering. But I still ended up in software development as this already had been a passion starting in my teenage years (who didn't want to become a game developer?).

I have extensive experience working in collaborative development teams (Scrum) as well as leading projects as a solo developer. I believe that successful software projects require more than just coding: they demand code reviews, comprehensive testing, and build automation.

My programming style is to write clean, readable code and at the same time be aware of the performance impact of my code.
